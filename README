== Lighthouse Addons

Package contains two addons:

1. Annotater - Convert your annotations into lighthouse tickets
2. Ticket Printer   - Print your lighthouse tickets to PDF.

== Configure before starting up

Rename lighthouse.example to lighthouse.yml and fill-in the required fields available in config directory.

== Lighthouse Annotater

Based on rake:notes, lighthouse annotater is prefixed with 'lh', 
so there are following rake tasks that convert annotations into lighthouse tickets:

rake lhnotes:todo
rake lhnotes:fixme
rake lhnotes:optimize

and

rake lhnotes to run all of them.

=== Customizing Annotates

You can provide additional options to annotates to set certain features related to lighthouse ticket. 
Currently the following features are provided:

1. Title: 
By default the title of lighthouse ticket will be in this format:
[TYPE OF ANNOTATION] - CUSTOM TITLE - FILE NAME - LINE NUMBER
Here you can set the CUSTOM TITLE by specifying the title in **, as: *this will be the title*
if CUSTOM TITLE is missing, first 25 characters of annotation will be used.

2. Code: 
You can encode code in double dots, as:
..:if => proc {|user| user.password?}..

3. Tags: 
Prefix any word with # and it will be added as a tag for that ticket.


=== A complete example:
# TODO: *Use #dynamic-finders*, like ..User.find_by_name(name).. in #models, #controllers

For this annotate,
title = Use #dynamic-finders
code =  User.find_by_name(name)
tags = dynamic-finders, models, controllers


== Lighthouse Ticket Printer

Based on rake:lhnotes, Lighthouse Ticket Printer gives the following tasks:

rake lhnotes:print:todo
rake lhnotes:print:fixme
rake lhnotes:print:optimize

and

rake lhnotes:print to print all of them.

To print individual tickets, use:

rake lhnotes:print ARGS

a. ARGS can be either individual ticket nos. or ticket ranges
b. ARGS need to be seperated by spaces and not comma.

ex:

rake lhnotes:print 1-5 7 9
rake lhnotes:print 10 15 27
